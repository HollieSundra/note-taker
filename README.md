# Note-Taker

For this challenge the client wanted an application created that can be ussed to write and save notes. The application would use Express.js for the back end which will allow saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting of user generated note data from a JSON file.

The applications front end was already designed. My responsibility was to create a connection between the back and front ends and deploy the finished product to Heroku.

## User Story

I want to be able to write and save notes
So that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
